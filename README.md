# Market Basket Optimization Analysis

Project Overview:
This project performs Market Basket Analysis on a transactional dataset to discover associations between products. The goal is to identify items that are frequently purchased together, which can inform marketing strategies, product placement, and bundle offers.

Dataset:
The analysis uses a dataset containing customer transactions, typically represented as a list of items bought in each transaction. (You might want to add more details about your specific dataset here, e.g., source, number of transactions, number of unique items).

Methodology:
Data Loading and Preprocessing: The raw transaction data is loaded and transformed into a suitable format for association rule mining.
Apriori Algorithm: The Apriori algorithm is applied to identify frequent itemsets and generate association rules.
Rule Interpretation: The generated rules are filtered and interpreted based on metrics like Support, Confidence, and Lift.

# Key Findings:
(This section can be updated after you complete your analysis and have specific insights to share. For example, 'Customers who buy X also tend to buy Y with a confidence of Z%'.)

Requirements:
Python 3.x
Pandas
Numpy
Apyori (for the Apriori algorithm)
